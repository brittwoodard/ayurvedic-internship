      roots deeply embedded in Ayurvedic heritage, my journey began in 2007, earning degrees from esteemed institutions

      extends beyond textbooks, incorporating practical wisdom and spiritual insights into health and wellness. Having
      shaped the future of Ayurveda as an assistant professor at SDM College of Ayurveda, I invite you to delve into the
      heart of Ayurveda.</p>
